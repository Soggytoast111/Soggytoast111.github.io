Hello world!  Welcome to my domain!

In this space you will find a little bit about me, as well as some links to recent projects that I have been working on.  I am currently maintaining this as part of Rutgers' Coding Bootcamp program, by the end of which I hope to expand my skills with front-end and back-end web development, as well as coding in general.

I currently work as a research and development engineer at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey - a position that I began after graduating from Rutgers University in 2008 with a B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering.  In my spare time, I enjoy some tinkering with or repairing old electronics - which is why I think coding would be a valuable skill for me to pick up.  

I run a little to keep in shape (but you won't find me finishing a marathon any time soon.)  I'm also into fighting games (specifically Street Fighter V) and try to keep up with the scene in my spare time.  If you want matches, track me down and hit me up!

I currently reside in Berkeley Heights with my wonderful girlfriend.  She's already been bugging me to help me design a website for her to show off her graphic arts projects.  No sweat!
